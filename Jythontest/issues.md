#### Goal One: Use Jythonc to generate jar file that can be used as a regular jar file for stored procedure.
* Concerns:
	* Jythonc only handles all the features of Python 2.2, but not later features.
	* Need to use signature. However, this might not be elegant, as the user needs to be familiar with the signatures too. Might need to consider automatic script rewrite.
